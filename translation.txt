After the Mesolithic Stone Age, Finland belonged to 5200 BC.
from the beginning of the Bronze Age (1700-500 BC.) the Seima-Turbino network brought bronze objects to the current Finnish territory.[45][46] At the same time, the use of textile ceramics spread to Finland.[47] The cemeteries typical of the Bronze Age are known in Finland for some 10 000.[48] During the Bronze Age, Finland began to show signs of agriculture.
Cash farming was carried out alongside fishing activities.[49][50] Stone Age Bearbuck.
The Finnish Iron Age lasted from about 500 B.C.E.
until 1200 C.E. [51][52] During the Iron Age, agriculture and livestock management became more common.

In the 12th to 12th centuries, cross-country and looting took place in Finland.[54] In rural folk religion, the features of Finnish ancient religion remained until the 20th century.[55] The time of Swedish rule Main articles: The Middle Ages of Finland and the time of Swedish rule in Finland The Middle Ages of Finland are considered to have begun with the origin of the first written sources.[56] The time of Swedish rule brought Finland into the sphere of Western European culture.[57] The oldest known written source of Finland is the Pope letter of 1171 or 1172.
The Bishop's seat has been operating in Varsinais-Suomi since the beginning of the 13th century.[58] The border between Sweden and Novgorod and the eastern border of Finland was defined in the peace of Nutkinäsaari in 1323.
As a result, Karelia was divided between Sweden and Novgorod.[59] The Church of Finland, the migration, legislation and administration of the Swedes, including taxation, provincial administration and castles, made the new areas more closely integrated into Sweden.[60] Olavinlinna was built in the 14th century In the Middle Ages, trade took a more established form.

Old Finland, or given-up areas, was added to the rest of Finland in 1812.
The capital city and the University of Turku after the fire were also transferred from Turku to Helsinki and the Senate and central offices were established.[67] In the 1880s, however, autonomy began to be reduced to the oppressive years of the 20th century.[62] Since the 1850s Finland's development was characterised by population growth, national awakening, industrialisation and economic growth and a liberal atmosphere.
Since the 1860s, after a break of several decades, the Parliaments were able to meet regularly.
In the 1890s, Finland’s statutes were granted the right of initiative to process laws.[68] Finland’s first railway was completed, and the first commercial bank was founded in the 1860s.

This was seen in Finland in 1899–1905 and 1908–1916 in the form of nationalization, i.e. Russianisation, directed at Finns.
These periods of oppression have been called by the Finns.[69] The first period of oppression was ended by the Great Strike of 1905.
As a result of the major strike, the statutes were abolished and the new constitution was decreed in 1906.

Ståhlberg established Finnish parliamentaryism in which, in addition to the parliament, the President had an important role.[75] The economic depression that began in Finland after 1928 led to the strengthening of communists and right-wing radicals.
The right-wing radical Lapua movement called for a law prohibiting Communist activity, and this was also the case.
The political field was right-wing, as reflected in the election of Pehr Evind Svinhufvud as President of the Republic in 1931.
In the summer of 1930, hundreds of left-wingers were kidnapped and assaulted by members of the Lapua Movement.
In 1932, the Lapua movement culminated in the Mäntsälä rebellion, which fell peacefully when the majority of the people and the armed forces gave their support to President Svinhufvud, who defended the republic.
The Lapua movement was abolished by law.[62] World War II in Finland Main article: Finland in World War II When World War II had begun, the Soviet Union began the Winter War at the end of November 1939.

After the Continuation War, some of the abandoned areas were integrated into the Karelian-Finnish Socialist Soviet Republic, while others into Leningrad and Murmansk.
With Germany, Finland had to wage the war in Lapland to expel German troops from Lapland.[62] Finnish troops will lift the flag to the border of the three kingdoms at the end of the Lapland War in April 1945.
In the latter part of the 20th century, during the long presidency of Urho Kekkonen (1956–81), Finland became a modern industrial and service society.
Since the 1960s, rural areas began to depopulate as the population moved to industrial centres and Sweden.
At the same time, the educational level of society began to rise in the 1970s with the transition to the comprehensive school system and the expansion of higher education.
In economic terms, Finland joined the European Free Trade Association and entered into a free trade agreement with the European Community.[76][77] During the presidency of Mauno Koivisto, Finland moved from a presidential centre to a more parliamentary system.
The bilateral trade between Finland and the Soviet Union had grown to a significant position in the economy of the Alvar Aalton Finlandia House.[78][79] When the Soviet Union broke down, Finland's Eastern trade collapsed in late 1990, which was the case for others in 1971.
Finland joined the European Union on 1 January.
Finland in the 21st century began to internationalise and the number of immigrants living in Finland increased.[83] In the years following the recession, Finnish people gained confidence in the profit cycle of information technology as the driving force of the economy.[84] The single currency for the use of the euro Finland moved to 1.
The dependence of Finland’s economy on foreign production increased throughout the 2000s.
In the forest industry in particular, several production plants had to be closed down.[86] The global economic crisis paralyzed Finland's exports in autumn 2008, and in the following year Finland's gross domestic product decreased by 8.5%.
Although the amount of GDP has grown in the early 2010s, it was still below the 2008 level in 2016.[87] Viking Grace Finland, manufactured in Finland, became a member of NATO in 2023.[88] on its way to the port of Turku.
